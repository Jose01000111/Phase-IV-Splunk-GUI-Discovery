# Phase IV — 🔑 GUI Discovery

**Objective:** Explore the Splunk GUI, understand its components, and document my findings. This serves as a glossary/reference for key elements in Splunk.

---

## **Dashboard 🖥️**
The Dashboard is my main workspace when I open Splunk. Here, I can see panels that summarize data and give me quick insights. I can access **Search & Reporting**, **Data Summary**, and **System Monitoring** directly from here.

## **Indexes 📂**
Indexes are where Splunk stores log data. I reviewed the default indexes to understand what Splunk tracks out-of-the-box:

- `_internal` → Logs generated by Splunk itself.  
- `_audit` → Tracks user actions and system activity.  
- `_introspection` → Stores system performance metrics.

## **Menus & Navigation 🧭**
The top menu lets me navigate Splunk’s main functionalities:

- **Search & Reporting** → Where I perform searches, create reports, and configure alerts.  
- **Settings** → Manages Users & Roles, Licenses, Server Settings, and Indexes.  
- **Apps** → Lists installed apps and lets me add new ones.

## **Dashboards & Triggered Alerts 📊⚡**
Dashboards provide visualizations of the data in Splunk. Triggered Alerts notify me when specific conditions are met in my searches or reports.

- **Dashboards** → Can be custom or default, showing panels with charts, tables, and metrics.  
- **Triggered Alerts** → Notify me via email, webhook, or in Splunk when certain thresholds or conditions are met.

### **Observations ✍️**
- The GUI is intuitive; menus clearly separate functionality.  
- Default dashboards and indexes give me a solid starting point for exploration.  
- Understanding triggered alerts will be essential when monitoring for suspicious activity or anomalies.

✅ **Tip:** Keeping a screenshot-based glossary like this in my GitHub portfolio shows both exploration and understanding of Splunk’s GUI for anyone reviewing my work.
